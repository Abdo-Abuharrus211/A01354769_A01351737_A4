ABDO DONT FORGET TO PLAY AARDWOLF

From assignment sheet:

- update character to start at level 1 per chris instruction @done
- we need to name the level ... im not 100% sure what this means... maybe what you were talking about as opposed to 1, 2 3?
- Check 4c of the assignment sheet - do you think the knowledge thing covers that? I can ask today
- hmm we should maybe put a tuple in somehwere... not sure where
- use of membership operator? what's this?
- we need to use itertools somewhere -> Make board
- we need to format output with f strings @Done

- do you have any knowledge on GUI? if it's a kinda easy to implement, and we have time we can... I think he said
  there might be bonus marks... tbc. What do you think? If it's hella effort then fuck it though



Add function annotations @done
Review docstrings - let's do this together
conduct doctests
Implement Unit tests - mainly done except for I think check_final_boss
 - move_character @done
 - create character
 - create board - can we call another function within the make board (ie make description?) I think it has to be stand
                alone no? Not sure how to unit test this - the error ones are done though
 - make_description
 - make_enemy
 - check_for_foes @done
 - dead_yet @done
-  level_up
 - check_final_boss - I don't want to touch this one coz it's linked in with how you have the game play flow but
                        is there the chance built into this or only XP?
 - final_boss @done
