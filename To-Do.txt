To-Do:
Implement the guessing game @done
Implement the boss battle @done







Add function annotations @done
Review docstrings
conduct doctests
Implement Unit tests - mainly done except for I think check_final_boss
 - move_character @done
 - create character
 - create board - can we call another function within the make board (ie make description?) I think it has to be stand
                alone no? Not sure how to unit test this - the error ones are done though
 - make_description
 - make_enemy
 - check_for_foes @done
 - dead_yet @done
-  level_up
 - check_final_boss - I don't want to touch this one coz it's linked in with how you have the game play flow but
                        is there the chance built into this or only XP?
 - final_boss @done
