WELCOME_MESSAGE = """ Oh, you're awake. Don't be alarmed little one. I know this is not the lucious garden you're kind
                    often reside in.\n We're at the 'Stacks', the Fantasy Stacks to be precise. Over yonder are the 
                    BioMedica shelves, stay clear of those.\n I must say, I wasn't expecting to see a caterpillar 
                    here in the AlphaNuma territories.\n The humans call it 'Bob's bookshop', and I'm Mothrandir,
                    I'll guide you through this labyrinth of tomes and scrolls."""
