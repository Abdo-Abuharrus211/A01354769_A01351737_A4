WELCOME_MESSAGE = """ Oh, you're awake. Don't be alarmed little one. I know this is not the lucious garden you're kind\n
                    often reside in. We're at the stacks, the fantasy stacks to be precise, over yonder are the 
                    Bio-Medical shelves, stay clear of those. \n I must say, I wasn't expecting to see a caterpillar 
                    here in the AlphaNuma territories.\n The humans call it Bob's bookshop, and I'm the Mothrandir,
                    I'll guide you through this labyrinth of tomes and scrolls."""
