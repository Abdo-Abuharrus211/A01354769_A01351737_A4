## Comments & Declarations:

We're going to make a game to rule all games!

## Narrative:

Our hero starts as a caterpillar born in a dusty, rustic, and homey bookstore in some small town.

For some odd reason they hatch among a bunch of tattered books, she’s a moth…

Our hero stumbles on some scrolls, etched on them are strange symbols with four points…They’re compass points! +20 XP.

They don’t know why per se, but our hero knows that they must traverse this strange land and find a high and peaceful
place and from there…

Our here begins its trek through this bizarre landscape over books, scrolls, dusty shelves, over exotic carpets of a far
away land, desks overwhelmed with receipts and rife with lakes of spilled coffee…

Along the way they’ll find friendly denizens of this kingdom that aid our hero in their endeavor. But they’ll also face
many a foe, for not all under the mountains of the library are innocent!

Foes will be cute critters that might be present in an old bookshop such as ants, spiders, moths, caterpillars, mice,
cats, a goldfish (in a bowl of course) a stray bird…etc. And the mighty Python of the Courtyard!

Each location will have a little description to transport the player {Big ass dictionary, with 0-99 descriptions}

In the center of the 10x10 grid is the Python of the Courtyard, this little cozy garden behind the book shop has a
little fountain and arbors, the garden’s overgrown with ferns, flowering shrubs, grasses, and a variety of water plants
crawling out of the koi pond.

But under the fair Lemon Tree lies they Python! Once a beloved pet, cast out into the wilds to fend for itself, it now
reins over the bookshop dominion with an iron coil! None dare challenge it!

Face the Python and its final questions to earn rite of passage to ascend.
